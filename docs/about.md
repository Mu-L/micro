After many years of working on platforms, it became clear 
there was no open source alternative to the types of tooling we saw emerge within large tech companies. 
With that in mind we set out to build a new set of tools.

In January 2015 we open sourced the [Go Micro](https://go-micro.dev) framework. Go Micro codifies a set of design patterns for microservice 
development including service discovery, rpc and pubsub messaging. Utilizing a pluggable architecture, 
Go Micro adapts to any infrastructure while maintaining the same tools and development patterns.
